            <h1>My Career</h1>
            <p>I graduated with a BA in History from Adrian College and spent a few years gaining financial planning and recruiting experience prior to finding my calling. I developed a strong interest in process improvement and implementation, and was determined to find ways to develop my skills. I entered into the University of Michiganâ€™s School of Information in Fall of 2015 as a rather non traditional part time student. I continued to work full tie as I pursued my specialization in Human Computer Interaction, focusing on Usability Research and Needs Evaluation. I completed my internship at Quicken Loans in Downtown Detroit as a Business Metrics Analyst Intern, and hope to graduate in December 2018</p>
